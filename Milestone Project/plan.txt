pair correlation function:

g(r) = n(r)/rho2pirdr
n(r) = number of particles in a shell of width dr

how to actually detect particles in this ring

then need to loop over different configurations to average the data

Milestone final step:

N=100 particles
n = (N(pi)(2r)^2)/4L^2
want n to equal 0.68 - get value of L such that n = 0.68
L = 

expect interesting peak for high density 0.72

get r axis in terms of diameter
get rid of dr loop and replace with L loop
decide on how to extend - lennard jones potential
