Plan for the progress of my project

1) Plot the particle positions from coordinates file/generate lattice - done!
2) Generate monte-carlo moves on the particles
3) Register collisions between particles - maybe calculate position vectors?


Monte-Carlo Moves:

import random, r = random.random()

Three things to account for:
	1) If particles overlap - this determines whether there is a 'move'
	2) Monte Carlo moves
    3) Periodic boundary conditions - make sure there is no overlapping

moves 'accepted' if the particles are not overlapping, i.e. have zero potential energy
moves 'rejected' if the particles are overlapping, i.e. have infinite potential energy - this is because the move is forbidden

moves are given by the formula 'dx = d(eta-0.5)'
this is also done for the y direction as well

pseudocode plan:

basic idea of code:
IF particles overlap: (checking this using a loop over all particles?)
THEN (DO monte-carlo moves)

more detailed:
generate x and y positions and plot them - set markersize to an amount such that there are some overlapped particles
For i in range(0,len(x)):
    if x[i]
